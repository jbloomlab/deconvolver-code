Grid/bin/grid-deconvolve.pl --sfffile_mode <OPTIONS>

The release of the deconvolution code includes an "sfffile_mode" option that 
enables the deconvolution process to work similarly to the sfffile deconvolver 
for any input dataset (.sff, .fasta, .fastq).  This option strictly searches for 
the key sequence adjacent to the barcode in the 5’-to-3’ direction. 

This option was added to provide a single software solution to handle both 
standard Roche MID barcoded data, and to handle custom barcode design protocols.  

Running in sfffile_mode does the following

1)	Automatically sets and/or validates the key sequence
	a.	For .sff files, it sets the key sequence using sffinfo, or validates a 
     user-provided key sequence.
     b.	For non-sff files, it requires that the user provide the key sequence.
    
2)	Searches for barcode pattern only on positive strand on input sequence files.

Note that there may be slight differences between the results of running sfffile 
versus grid-deconvolve.pl in sfffile_mode.  The key differences are the sfffile 
tolerates gaps and does not count them against the allowable mismatch threshold, 
and sfffile looks for a sequence alignment only at the very beginning of the 
read sequence.  grid-deconvolve.pl uses fuzznuc from Emboss tools to search the 
entire string for an allowable match. 

There is a test case included in the repository to validate sfffile_mode
